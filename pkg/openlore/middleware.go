// Actor is non-durable context about the principal that triggered an operation.
// It flows into middleware for decisions, gating, and audit. It is deliberately
// NOT part of vfs.ChangeSet: proposer/approver identity is the consumer's record
// and decision input, never part of the content-addressed change.

// ── Admission (pre-commit write) chain ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The admission chain runs synchronously in the caller's goroutine BEFORE a
// mutation reaches the write log. It sits inside the fixed, deployment-owned
// scope layer, so it only ever sees in-scope writes. Middleware inspect the
// (immutable) ChangeSet and either allow, defer, or reject:
//
//	allow  → return next(ctx, op)                                 (commit path)
//	defer  → return WriteResult{}, &vfs.PendingChangeError{...}   (park; do NOT call next)
//	reject → return WriteResult{}, err                            (refuse)
//
// Middleware MUST treat op.ChangeSet as immutable — inspect and decide only,
// never rewrite the proposed bytes or snapshot.

// WriteOp is the input to the admission chain.

// for both fresh writes and approved held changesets. It is where the feed and

// ── Read chain ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The read chain runs BEFORE a read reaches the substrate. It is a
// before-read gate: a middleware can run work (e.g. a debounced git pull) and,
// on failure, abort the read by returning an error. It does not transform the
