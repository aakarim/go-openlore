// of (or land on) a removed path.

// It is in-memory and non-durable by design: with await semantics (Submit
// blocks until the applier replies) nothing is ever "accepted" until it is
// applied and durable in the substrate, so a crash loses only in-flight,
// un-acknowledged writes — the caller's Submit returns an error and it retries.
// Durability lives in the substrate and, for pending changes, the consumer's
