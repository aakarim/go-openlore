## About

AI coding agents already know how to explore files with `ls`, `cat`, `grep`,
`find`, pipes, and shell loops. OpenLore gives them that same interface over
SSH, backed by your documentation instead of a real machine.

```text
Agent ──SSH or MCP──▶ OpenLore ──▶ docs, knowledge, and artifacts
```

It starts as a single-binary, zero-config, read-only documentation server. When
you need a live knowledge base, you can add identity-scoped access, controlled
publishing, atomic writes, validation, and human approval without changing how
agents read or navigate the content.

## Features

- **Agent-native retrieval** — Agents use the shell tools and composition
  patterns they already understand instead of learning a bespoke retrieval API.
- **One knowledge surface, multiple transports** — Serve the same virtual
  filesystem over SSH, SFTP/SSHFS, MCP, and a human-friendly web view.
- **Live, governed knowledge** — Keep content read-only, allow scoped publishing,
  or enable full writes per docset. Writes are atomic, conflict-aware, and can
  require human approval.
- **Identity-scoped views** — Give each person or agent only the docsets it
  needs, with role-based `ro`, `publish`, and `rw` grants, path aliases, and
  private home directories.
- **Safe by construction** — The shell is an in-memory Go interpreter, not a
  real operating-system shell. There is no shell escape, arbitrary process
  execution, or ambient network access in a normal session.
- **Portable knowledge bundles** — Embed docs into a self-contained binary,
  build cross-platform bundles with the GitHub Action, or package them as a
  desktop MCP extension.
- **Structured knowledge without a new query language** — Inspect frontmatter
  as NDJSON with `lore meta`, query it with `jq`, and validate Google's
  [Open Knowledge Format (OKF)](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md)
  bundles and Agent Skills close to the write path.
- **Extensible policy and processing** — Plugins can add validation, grants,
  read/write middleware, metadata, and post-commit processing while preserving
  the same filesystem interface.

## Use Cases

- **Documentation for coding agents** — Put internal API docs, runbooks, product
  context, and architecture notes behind a familiar, greppable interface.
- **A shared live memory for teams of agents** — Give agents separate or shared
  docsets so they can publish findings, hand off work, and accumulate durable
  context across sessions.
- **Skills sharing** — Publish Agent Skills into shared collections so every
  authorized agent can discover and use the same governed procedures.
- **Governed knowledge contribution** — Let contributors publish into inboxes
  while reserving sensitive paths for approvers and preventing accidental
  overwrites.
- **Remote review of agent artifacts** — Expose reports, logs, screenshots, and
  generated files through the browser or SSH without building a custom artifact
  viewer or granting access to the agent's machine.
- **Identity-specific workspaces** — Mount a private home for each agent plus
  shared team knowledge, all through one server and one authorization model.
- **Portable customer or project knowledge** — Ship a versioned executable with
  the relevant docs embedded, or distribute the same knowledge as an MCPB
  desktop extension.
- **Validated knowledge catalogs** — Enforce frontmatter and bundle conventions,
  inspect metadata cheaply, and stop malformed knowledge at admission time.

## Quick Start

The fastest path is to let your agent set up OpenLore:

```bash
# Teach your agent how to install, configure, and bundle OpenLore
ssh openlore.sh teach | your-agent-cli

# Add documentation access instructions to AGENTS.md
ssh openlore.sh agents >> AGENTS.md
```

Or install and run it directly:

```bash
go install github.com/aakarim/go-openlore/cmd/openlore@latest

openlore ./docs

ssh -p 2222 localhost
ssh -p 2222 localhost "grep -r 'authentication' /docs"
```

By default this starts:

- SSH on `localhost:2222`
- the human-facing web view on `http://localhost:8080`
- MCP over HTTP on `http://localhost:8080/mcp`

See [Ways to use OpenLore](docs/usage.md) for embedded binaries, MCP stdio,
MCPB packaging, SSHFS, the GitHub Action, and Go library usage.

## How It Works

OpenLore is built on [Wish](https://github.com/charmbracelet/wish) for SSH
transport. A connection is handled entirely against a virtual filesystem:

1. **Authenticate** — connect keylessly or resolve an SSH key, certificate,
   passkey, or OAuth login to an identity.
2. **Compose a view** — mount only the docsets and paths granted to that identity.
3. **Explore** — run shell commands implemented as pure Go functions over that
   view, or use the equivalent MCP `shell` tool.
4. **Contribute safely** — if writing is enabled, authorize and validate a
   whole-file change before committing it atomically or routing it for approval.

The normal shell cannot invoke `bash`, `exec`, `curl`, or arbitrary host
processes. Embedded documentation is always read-only. Explicitly trusted
identities can be granted narrowly scoped asynchronous processing through the
`spawn` capability.

## Governed Writing

OpenLore is read-only by default. Writable deployments keep a single,
policy-controlled write path for redirects, append, `tee`, `patch`, `sed -i`,
file moves, publishing, and approved external jobs.

```bash
echo "# Research" | publish backend findings.md
cat change.diff | patch /backend/api.md
sed -i 's/old/new/g' /backend/runbook.md
```

Writes are whole-object atomic swaps. Compare-and-swap protection rejects stale
edits by default, docset grants constrain the target, and selected paths can
produce reviewable changesets under `/requests` instead of committing directly.

See [Writing and publishing](docs/writing.md) for user-facing setup and
[Write system internals](docs/write-system.md) for the implementation model.

## Security

- Commands run in a pure-Go interpreter, not through `os/exec`.
- The virtual filesystem cleans paths and enforces docset boundaries.
- Allowed file patterns and ignored directories keep secrets out of the view.
- RBAC controls reads, publishing, writes, approvals, and trusted capabilities.
- The web endpoint can publish the SSH host key over TLS to avoid blind trust on
  first use; SSH user and host certificates are also supported.
